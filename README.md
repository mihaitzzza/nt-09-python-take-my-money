### Who am I?
I am client from USA with an urgency to find out some stats about the products I am selling. Since I am a non-techical person, I only know how to work with `csv` and `json` formats. I am ready to pay you 1.000 USD for a program that I can run locally and solve my problem.

### Requirements
- the client should be able to decide if the data is read from `json` or from `csv`
- the client should be able to decide if the data is write to `json` or to `csv`
- read product details from a file. Each product has some particular details: name, description, normal price, price, color, size, gender, quantity, sales
- create a folder and write down the stats, each one in a file

### Data to be filtered out
- products which are on a promotion
- most saled products (min. 1000 pieces)
- most unsaled products (max. 10 pieces)
- all products by color
- all products by gender
